### Project Title: House Price Prediction

#### Project Description
This project focuses on predicting house prices using a dataset containing various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and amenities. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to build a model that accurately estimates house prices based on these attributes.

#### Objectives
- **Data Collection**: Utilize a dataset containing historical house prices and relevant features.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- **Model Development**: Implement regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict house prices.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.

#### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

#### Expected Outcomes
- A predictive model that estimates house prices.
- A report detailing model performance and insights from the analysis.
- Visualizations to highlight important features affecting prices.
